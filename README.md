# Data_analysic-dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in excel,creating multiple dashboard and tables to analyze the data.This process involved several stages,including data preprocessing,data cleaning, and data visualization
interactive Excel dashboard completely from scratch on the richest people in the world, where we can filter by certain criteria, navigate across the different sections, and refresh our data, and much more. Doing this efficiently has taken me years to learn, so let me show the full workflow step by step. First, we'll analyze the dataset to identify the relevant areas with pivot tables. Second, we'll lay out the dashboard structure with shapes and textboxes. Third, we'll create the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and charts / visuals like a combo chart and a bar chart. Finally, we'll make the dashboard dynamic with pivot table slicers and a navigation bar using hyperlinks so we can navigate across the different worksheets.
